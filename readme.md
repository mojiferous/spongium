###About
TSpongium is a browser game built entirely in Javascript and open-sourced under CC Attribution 3.0. That means you can take it, disassemble it, rebuild your own version, laugh at my terrible coding, and do with it as you will. As long as you mention somewhere that it is based on my half-assed work. You can even credit my pseudonym.

###Instructions
insert boilerplate here

###Notes
Built using canvas and object-oriented Javascript and tested primarily in WebKit-based browsers on Mac OS. Older versions of Firefox, IE, and other browsers may not display or run the game correctly. I neither have the time nor the desire to test and convert the game to function properly in an IE environment, and encourage someone to pull, edit, and push those changes to the repository. _See above about nobody having time for that._
